Welcome to TRENCAT's documentation!
===================================

**TRENCAT is a train simulator platform to put into practice research algorithms in Train Automation Technologies**. Whether you want to develop and test cutting-edge mathematics or just want to play around, this software is for you. For now it covers the following topics:

   - **Optimal Layout Design**: Choose a location in a map and start building your own railway infrastructure. You can easily build either railway infrastructure at country level and underground railway at city level. It's time to shape the layout of the future!
   - **Optimal Train Scheduling**: Fixed train timetables are useful for passengers to organize their journeys. Define your own schedule and find a balance between traffic fluidity and efficiency while meeting passengers load demand.
   - **Optimal Rolling Stock Planning**: How many convoys should be used to satisfy passengers demand? 
   - **Real Time Automatic Train Operation**: Can you make your train drive between two stations? Your train will have to stick to speed limitations, respect semaphore signalling, and, of course, arrive on time.
   - **Train Coordination**: Now that a few hundreds of trains are being driven automatically, they must circulate coordinately in order to ensure passengers safety. Orchestrate railway traffic by setting maximum velocity of track segments and managing semaphores.
   - **Passenger Demand**: Of course, non of the previous points would exist if there were no passengers. Is the railway infrastructure resilient to sudden demand changes? Can the infrastructure deal with high passengers demand over a long time? What routes are passengers likely to take to go from one place to another? It's time to test your designing skills!

Currently this project is still under design and developing proofs of concepts of state of the art algorithms. The documentation in here is just a first draft and will be constantly reviewed during implementation stages.

That's all, enjoy it! Just contact us if you are interested in contributing :)
