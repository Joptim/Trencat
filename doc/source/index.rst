Welcome to TRENCAT's documentation!
===================================

**TRENCAT is a train simulator platform prepared for any student who wants to put into practice his/her own research in Train Automation Technologies**. Whether you want to develop cutting-edge mathematics and test them or just want to poke around, this software is for you. For now it covers the following topics:

   - **Optimal Layout Design**: The current train and Metro layouts have been built step by step, starting from many years ago until today. Bearing in mind that population needs a century ago were different from today's needs, which would be today the most efficient railway layout that would meet current society's needs? Is such layout feasible in practice?
   - **Optimal Train Scheduling**: Since the beginning of train history, train departures and arrivals still obey fixed timetables. Fixed timetables are useful for passengers to organize their journeys, but is the railway traffic efficient? How should traffic be scheduled to maximize efficiency?
   - **Optimal Rolling Stock Planning**: How many convoys should be used to satisfy passengers demand? Could the number of trains be reduced by optimising train scheduling and rolling stock planning together?
   - **Real Time Automatic Train Operation**: Traditionally trains are manually driven by drivers. Nowadays, train public transport has achieved an impressive level of safety, punctuality, speed and energy efficiency due to automation. What mathematical algorithms are being used to perform automation?
   - **Train Coordination**: Now that a few hundreds of trains are being driven automatically, they must circulate coordinately in order to ensure passengers safety. How all trains are orchestrated in a railway infrastructure?
   - **Passenger Demand**: Of course, non of the previous points would exist if there were no passengers demanding this service. Is the railway infrastructure resilient to sudden demand changes? Can the infrastructure deal with high passengers demand over a long time? What routes are passengers likely to take to go from one place to another?
   
Currently this project is still under design. The documentation in here is just a first draft and will be constantly reviewed during implementation stages.

That's all, enjoy it! Just contact us if you are interested in contributing :)
