Railway Traffic Control
=======================

The :ref:`railway-traffic-control` is responsible for determining the rolling stock (i.e. the number of trains that are running), the routes of all trains and timetables. Usually the rolling stock and the train schedule are determined together. In this section, however, we assume that rolling stock is already determined and that routes are are also known and we introduce the very basics of train schedule modeling. The model and examples of this section are inspired by [DPP]_ and [CHKKTVW]_.

Section :ref:`optimal-rolling-stock-planning` introduces the rolling stock planning problem.
