Optimal Layout Design
=====================
The railway infrastructure layout is the result of history. Traditionally, railways were built to satisfy society needs in terms of passengers transportation and factory production, both for raw materials importation and product exportation. New lines were added gradually taking into account the existing ones. As a consequence, current layouts may not be the optimally efficient in terms of track length, traveling time, energy losses, etc. Some questions come up naturally.

1. What do we understand when we talk about improving line efficiency? Are we minimizing energy losses, are we minimizing track length and traveling time? Are we minimizing monetary costs?
2. Next, nowadays which would be the most efficient feasible railway layout that meets society requirements?
