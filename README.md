# TRENCAT

*TRENCAT* is a train simulator platform prepared for any student who wants to put into practice his/her own research in Train Automation Technologies. *TRENCAT* allows users to test custom implementations in **Optimal Railway Layout Design**, **Optimal Train Scheduling**, **Optimal Rolling Stock Planning**, **Real Time Unattended Train Operation** and **Passenger Demand modelisation**. Check the official documentation https://trencat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.

## Developing stage

Currently *TRENCAT* is implementing proofs of concepts of the state of the art algorithms and the architecture explained in documentation.

## Getting Started

Every proof of concept includes a Dockerfile to run it in a Docker (Linux based) container. *TRENCAT* is available in all platforms supporting Docker.

## Prerequisites

All docker images and containers have been created with Docker Client version `19.09.0` and Docker Engine - Community `18.09.0` (API version `1.39`).
