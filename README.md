# TrenCAT

*TrenCAT* is a train simulator platform prepared for any student who wants to put into practice his/her own research in Train Automation Technologies. *Trencat* allows users to test custom implementations in **Optimal Railway Layout Design**, **Optimal Train Scheduling**, **Optimal Rolling Stock Planning**, **Real Time Unattended Train Operation** and **Passenger Demand modelisation**.

Currently *TrenCAT* is being designed and no implementation has yet started.

## Deployment

This section will be filled in the future.

## Compile documentation

In Windows, open a console in the source folder:

```
:: Install virtualenv if you don't have it yet
pip install virtualenv

:: Create a virtualenv just for documentation libraries
virtualenv virtualenv_doc

:: Activate it
virtualenv_doc\\Scripts\\activate.bat

:: Install Sphinx and dependencies
pip install -r doc\\requirements.txt

:: Build html documentation in doc\\build\\html
cd doc
sphinx-build -b html source build\\html
```

In Linux, open the command line in the source folder

```
# Install pip if you don't have it yet
sudo apt install python3-pip

# Install virtualenv if you don't have it yet
sudo pip3 install virtualenv

# Create a virtualenv just for documentation libraries
virtualenv virtualenv_doc

# Activate it
source virtualenv_doc/bin/activate

# Install Sphinx and dependencies
pip install -r doc/requirements.txt

# Build html documentation in doc/build/html
cd doc
sphinx-build -b html source build/html
```
