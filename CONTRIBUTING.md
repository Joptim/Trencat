# Contributing

It's nice to have you here! You can contribute in *TrenCAT* project in many ways.
1. As a software developer, you may contribute by improving platform design, implementation and documentation.
2. As a graphic designer, you may contribute in SCADA's graphic user interface and even in the public image of the brand.
3. As an engineer, mathematician, scientist or just motivated user, you may contribute by implementing new algorithms in **Optimal Layout Design**, **Optimal Train Scheduling**, **Real Time Automatic Train Operation** and **Passenger Demand**.
4. You may also contribute to the project's documentation by fixing language mistakes, improving explanations and even translating documentation to your preferred language.

Is there a way you want to contribute that is not listed here? Just let the owners know it! All contributors will appear in a deliberately visible location in the project.

In any case, please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Steps for contributing in the platform

1. Please first discuss the change you wish to make via an issue with the owners of this repository before making a change.
2. Fork the repository on GitHub. Run the tests to ensure that your builds work correctly. If any test fails, you should investigate the reason. If you are not able to find out why it fails, then open a bug report on Github. However, before you raise a bug report one, please check through the GitHub issues, both open and closed, to confirm that the bug hasnâ€™t been reported before.
3. If you are reporting a bug, you should write tests proving such bug.
4. Write your bug fix or new feature.
5. Make tests to demonstrate that the bug is fixed or that the new feature works as intended.
6. Send a GitHub Pull Request to the master branch. The code will then be reviewed by the owners and finally accepted and merged.

## Steps for contributing as a graphic designer

1. Please contact the owners and express your intention to design SCADA's graphic user interface or brand's public image. If you are used to GitHub, contact the owners via an issue. If not, just contact the owners via email.
2. Come what may.

## Steps for contributing on new module implementations

1. Please contact the owners and express your intention to contribute on new module implementations.
2. Fork the repository on GitHub.
3. Implement your magic. Concrete module's documentation should give you enough information to know how to integrate your implementation with *TrenCAT* platform. If you don't know how to integrate your software with *TrenCAT*, please contact the owners via a GitHub issue and we'll kindly help you.
4. Write native language tests to make sure that your implementation is stable and resilient. Make sure your software passes them.
5. Write accurate and comprehensive documentation with the algorithms that you used. Also document your code accurately with language native documentation tools. For instance, check native `Godoc <https://blog.golang.org/godoc-documenting-go-code>`_ documentation tool for `Golang <https://golang.org/>`_ and `python docstring <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/>`_ for `Python <https://www.python.org/>`_. Make sure that your name (either real or fake) appears in documentation to make clear who wrote it.
5. Send a GitHub Pull Request to the master branch. The changes will then be reviewed by the owners and finally accepted and merged.

## Steps for contributing on project's documentation
Ideally, any documentation mistakes should be reported via a GitHub issue. Alternatively, if mistake(s) are simple enough, you may contact any of the owners with the details to find and fix the mistake.

If you are interested in improving current documentation, either by improving explanations or including new subjects, please do follow the next steps.

1. Please first announce what points of the documentation you wish to improve or what subjects you want to add via a GitHub issue.
2. Fork the repository on GitHub.
3. Add your changes. Make sure that you sign the articles with your name (either real or fake) and include a contact email.
4. Send a GitHub Pull Request to the master branch. The changes will then be reviewed by the owners and finally accepted and merged.

Finally, if you are interested in translating documentation, you may want to follow these steps.

1. Please first announce your intention to translate documentation to a different language via a GitHub issue.
2. Fork the repository on GitHub.
3. *TrenCAT* documentation is written in Sphinx, which already supports easy language internationalization. Please follow these [steps](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/intl.html) to generate the *.po* and *.mo* translation files.
4. Translate documentation in your preferred language.
5. Send a GitHub Pull Request to the master branch. The changes will then be reviewed by the owners and finally accepted and merged.
